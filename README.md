# Allstate-Claim-Severity-Kaggle-Competition
The problem with a prediction of a loss value in the insurance claim is posted in the Kaggle competition. 
Involving preprocessing techniques such as “1-of-k-encoding” and outliers, a formalized learning procedure including the “three-way data 
splits” and our methodology of hyperparameters selection consisting of four phases, activation, architecture, outliers and epochs, 
and learning rate including regularization, this paper tackles the “Allstate claims severity” problem using a deep neural network model. 
Experiments with 21 entries to the competition demonstrates how to reach to a minimum error.

This repository contains the final paper and R code.
